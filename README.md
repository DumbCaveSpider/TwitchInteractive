Twitch Interactive is a mod that allows both Twitch Streamers and Viewers to interact directly in game.

This mod was heavily inspired by **ArcticWoof's Interactive Level Request** streams and works seemlessly between the game and Twitch.

It provides a lot of quality of life and ease of use that makes your interactive streaming more fun or chaotic!


## Usage
- Open the **Twitch Dashboard** button which is located at the bottom left of the **Creator Page** or top right at the **Pause Menu**

- Read the Handbook which is located at the **Dashboard** or at the **Commands Settings** to learn more about the mod.

- This is a very complex and in-depth mod so please take your time to read over everything this mod has to offer.

## Disclaimer
- The mod doesn't use chatbots to work!
- The mod doesn't support sending messages to your stream chat due to the API only limited to **Read-only**.
## Support

## Credits
- Huge Thanks to [Alphalaneous](https://gdbrowser.com/u/1139015) for adding [Twitch Chat API](https://geode-sdk.org/mods/alphalaneous.twitch_chat_api) to make this mod possible!
- Inspired by [CrowdControl Geode Mod](https://github.com/WarpWorld/CCPack-PC-GeometryDash), I created this mod purely because CC's codebase was... questionable...
- [Cheeseworks](https://gdbrowser.com/u/6408873) - For cleaning up my horrible messy code
