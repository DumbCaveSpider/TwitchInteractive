Twitch Interactive is a mod that provides both Twitch Streamers and Viewers have an intergreted experience with the game.

This mod was heavily inspired by **ArcticWoof's Interactive Level Request** streams and made it to work seemlessly in game.

It provides a lot of quality of life and ease of use that makes your interactive streaming more fun for both you and your viewers!
## Usage
- To use this mod, you can open the **Twitch Dashboard** which is located both at the Game Pause Menu and Creator Tab. You will find a Twitch Button *(wrench button)* and which will ask you to link your Twitch Account to the dashboard.

- If you need to know how everything this mod has to offer, please refer to the handbook which is located at the **Dashboard** or at the **Commands Settings**.

- This is a very complex and in-depth mod so please take your time to read over everything on this mod.
