TODO:
[Important]
- FREAKING FIX THE TwitchCommandManger.hpp OML I CRAP MYSELF 
(i want it to move the functions and logic to the main file without breaking the entire code)
[Minor]
- add scale player event
- add player control event (reverse player, invert player)
- add Open Level Info (allows users/viewers to directly open a level xd "LevelInfo")
- custom global prefix command
