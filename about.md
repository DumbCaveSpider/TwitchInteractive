# Twitch Interactive
to do:
- add cheats/hacks when triggered certain commands (couldve just use some sort of inbuilt geode thingy to do it)
- make so certain commands can only work on certain layer like commands only triggered in play area
- make it only triggered based on the user role (eg. user, vip, mod, subscriber)
- channel point commands (alpha needs to add this on twitch api so cant add)
- ?
- profit
