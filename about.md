# Twitch Interactive

> ![icon](frame:highObjectIcon_001.png) <cy>This is still in Beta and not all features are currently present at this build. Expect bugs!</c>

## About
<cp>Twitch Interactive</c> is a mod that allows Twitch Viewers to interact directly in game.

You can create your own <cy>Chat commands</c> and <cy>Actions</c> that can be used by your viewers to interact with the game from making a <co>simple jump action</c> to a more complex actions and every actions are <cg>fully customizable</c>!

This mod was heavily inspired by **ArcticWoof's Interactive Level Request** streams and works seemlessly between Geometry Dash and Twitch.

It provides lots of in-game events that makes your interactive streaming more <cg>fun</c> or <cr>chaotic</c>!
## Usage
- Open the <cp>**Twitch Dashboard**</c> button which is located at the bottom left of the **Creator Page** *(The page where all of the creator buttons are -_-)* or top right at the **Pause Menu**
- Read the <cg>**Handbook**</c> which is located at the **Dashboard** or at the **Commands Settings** to learn more about the mod.
- This is a <cr>very complex and in-depth mod</c> which required you to read over everything this mod has to offer.
## Disclaimer
- <cr>The mod is not a chatbot replacement, you may need an external way to moderate the usage of this mod.</c>
- <cr>The mod doesn't support sending messages to your stream chat due to the API only limited to **Read-only**.</c>
- <cr>There won't be any YouTube support at this moment, unless someone made a YouTube Chat API on Geode which I could use.</c>

## Credits
- Huge Thanks to [Alphalaneous](user:1139015) for adding [Twitch Chat API](mod:alphalaneous.twitch_chat_api) to make this mod possible!
- Inspired by [CrowdControl Geode Mod](https://github.com/WarpWorld/CCPack-PC-GeometryDash), I created this mod purely because CC's codebase was... questionable... and limited... and boring...
- [Cheeseworks](user:6408873) for cleaning up my horrible messy code and for the mod icon
